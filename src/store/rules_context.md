In 1941: Race to Moscow, players take the roles of chiefs of staff or quartermasters of three massive Army Groups, formed from close to two hundred divisions, aiming at three targets in the Soviet Union: Moscow, Leningrad, and Rostov. The campaign was planned to be swift and daring, with a goal to reach the objectives before winter. In reality, after the final push known as Operation Typhoon, the invading troops reached the vicinity of Moscow and looked through binoculars at the Kremlin spires on one frosty December morning. Then the Soviet counteroffensive started.

Your job is to keep the logistics chain working and to make sure the Blitzkrieg moves as quickly as possible so that the targets are reached on time. This means supplying fuel to tanks, ammunition to guns, food to troops, and fodder to horses. The player who acquires the most medals wins the game. It is also possible to bet everything on one decisive strike and finish the war by conquering Moscow, Leningrad, or Rostov.

Inventory
The game box contains a rulebook, a game board, plastic Army miniatures, Army cards, Pursuit cards, Soviet cards, OKH cards, Front cards, player aid cards, Logistics cards, plastic supply tokens representing fuel, ammunition, and food, plastic transport markers representing trucks and trains, bunker miniatures, cardboard markers including player markers, Soviet markers, medal tokens, HQ markers, air support markers, and a fleet marker, as well as ziplock bags for storing components. The game was produced with care for quality and completeness, and replacement parts can be requested if needed.

Core Concepts
Each player begins the game with one or two Armored Armies and two or three Field Armies. Armored Armies are crucial forces that can move up to three areas and must be carefully supplied. Field Armies usually move one area per activation, but may move two areas by forced march at the cost of food. The gray player also controls the Fleet unit, which is used to control sea areas and cut Soviet supply routes to Baltic ports.

Army cards show the supplies currently possessed by each Army on the board. Each Army card has six spaces for supply tokens, and an Army may never hold more than six supplies. Supply types include fuel, used mainly for Armored Army movement and sometimes combat; ammunition, used for combat and entering fortified areas; and food, used during Theater Re-Organization and forced marches.

Other Terms and Concepts
During the game, players use their Army cards and their own deck of Pursuit cards. Each time an Army enters an uncontrolled area without a Soviet marker, a Pursuit card is drawn and resolved. When entering an area with a Soviet marker, a Soviet card is drawn instead. Soviet cards represent organized enemy defense. OKH cards represent special actions and capabilities available to players. Front cards define Soviet Reaction priorities for each Army Group.

Transport tokens include trucks and trains. Trucks represent road transport and can move up to four supplies, while trains represent rail transport and can move up to six supplies. Trains are shared among players, while trucks are player-specific.

The Game Board
The game is played on a point-to-point map of the Eastern Front. Areas are connected by colored lines representing movement routes. Some areas are fortified and require ammunition to enter. Victory areas represent Moscow, Leningrad, and Rostov. Supply bases allow placement of supplies, and objective areas provide medals when captured. Rail coverage enables train transport, and sea areas are used by the Fleet.

Markers
Player markers indicate control of areas and rail coverage. HALT markers indicate grounded Armies due to lack of food. Soviet markers represent enemy presence and determine game progression. Medal tokens represent prestige earned by capturing objectives. HQ and air support markers enable special actions.

Game Setup
Players choose an Army Group and sit according to board orientation. Army cards are placed face up, Armies are placed in starting areas, Pursuit decks are shuffled, and starting supplies are placed on Army cards. Player markers, trucks, and trains are set aside as resources. Supplies are placed in Main Supply Bases and the Supply Stock, and trains are placed in the Transportation Stock and Transport Reserve. Logistics levels are set to level one.

Soviet cards are divided into decks and prepared. Front cards are assigned, medals are placed on objective areas, and OKH cards are revealed. Player order is determined, and non-first players receive a medal. Special rules apply for two-player and solitaire games.

Gameplay
The game is played in rounds. On each turn, a player performs two regular actions, which may include Army movement, fleet movement, transporting supplies, taking supplies, or taking transport. Theater Re-Organization may be triggered. Additional actions may be performed using cards or special markers. Each turn ends with Railhead Advancement and Soviet Reaction.

End Game and Victory
The game ends when a player achieves immediate victory or when the Soviet marker pool is depleted and the round ends. Immediate victory is achieved by capturing a key city with a continuous supply connection. If no immediate victory occurs, the player with the most medals wins. Special scoring rules apply for solitaire play.

Army Movement
Players may move all Field Armies or one Armored Army per action. Movement follows colored connections. Armored Armies require fuel to move and may move up to three areas. Field Armies may perform forced marches using food. Entering fortified areas requires ammunition. Card draws occur when entering new areas, and combat or movement effects are resolved immediately.

Combat
Combat occurs when enemy units are encountered. Victory requires spending the supplies indicated on the enemy card. Defeated enemy cards are added to the player’s resources. If an Army lacks sufficient supplies, it retreats.

Encirclement
Uncontrolled areas become encircled if they cannot trace a path to a Victory Area. Encircled areas become controlled by the player, Soviet markers are removed, and Soviet cards are awarded. Encirclement occurs immediately when conditions are met.

Fleet Movement
The Fleet may move once per turn between adjacent sea areas. It blocks Soviet supply lines and enables encirclement via harbors.

Transport Supplies
Trucks and trains are placed to transport supplies between controlled areas. Transport occurs immediately upon placement and is one-way. Limits are defined by Logistics levels. Rail transport requires continuous rail connections to supply bases.

Take Supply
Players may take supplies from the Supply Stock and place them in supply bases or frontline bases, subject to capacity limits. Supply availability is limited.

Take Transport
Players may take trucks and trains from the Transport Stock, respecting Logistics limits. Depleting the Transport Stock triggers Theater Re-Organization.

Theater Re-Organization
All players advance Logistics levels, all transport is returned to stock, and all Armies consume food. Armies without food become grounded. Additional trains are added to the Transport Stock. HQ and air support markers are refreshed.

Air Support
Air support allows a player to peek at a deck and reduce supply costs for combat or fortified entry. Each player has one air support marker, which is refreshed after Theater Re-Organization.

Army Group HQs and OKH Cards
HQs allow players to take OKH cards, which grant special actions. After use, OKH cards are discarded.

Railhead Advancement
Players may flip player markers to extend rail coverage, enabling efficient supply transport.

Soviet Reaction
At the end of each turn, Soviet markers are placed or counterattacks occur according to Front card priorities. Counterattacks remove player markers under specific conditions.

Optional Rules
Optional rules include Army redeployment by rail, increased difficulty variants, and the Abwehr variant allowing free Soviet marker placement.

Soviet Player Variant
In this variant, one player controls Soviet actions, markers, and reactions. Soviet markers are placed secretly and determine the type of enemy encountered. Victory is determined by medal counts remaining on the board.
