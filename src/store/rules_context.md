1941: Race to Moscow — Consolidated Rules Manual (English)
1. Theme and Objective

In 1941: Race to Moscow, each player commands one of three German Army Groups as a chief of staff/quartermaster, driving an ambitious campaign toward key Soviet objectives. Your main job is to keep the logistics chain working so your forces can move and fight fast enough to seize territory and earn prestige.

You win either by:

Immediate Victory: capturing your assigned key city (or Moscow, depending on role) with a continuous supply-line connection, or

Standard Victory: having the most medals when the game ends normally.

Players can also “bet everything” on a decisive strike to capture Moscow, Leningrad, or Rostov (subject to the Immediate Victory rules and supply-line requirements).

3. Core Concepts
3.1 Players, Army Groups, and Forces

Each player controls an Army Group:

Gray (Army Group “Nord”)

White (Army Group “Mitte”)

Brown (Army Group “Sud”)

Each player starts with 1 or 2 Armored Armies (Panzergruppe) and 2 or 3 Field Armies (exact distribution depends on the player’s Army cards provided).

The gray player also controls the Fleet, which operates in sea areas and is important for cutting Soviet sea-based communication.

3.2 Army Cards and Supply Capacity

Army cards track the supplies carried by each Army miniature on the board.

Each Army card has 6 supply spaces.

An Army cannot hold more than 6 supplies on its card.

The printed supply symbols in those spaces are used only during setup.

3.3 Supply Tokens

There are three supply types:

Fuel: used for Armored Army movement and sometimes in combat

Ammo: used in combat and sometimes for movement (notably entering fortified areas)

Food: used during Theater Re-Organization and sometimes for Field Army forced march

Supplies spent are returned to the Supply Stock. Supplies gained from card effects are taken from the Supply Stock, but the stock is limited: if a supply type runs out, players cannot gain/take that supply.

3.4 Transport Tokens

Transport is represented by:

Trucks: road transport; each truck can move up to 4 supplies one-way in the moment it is placed. Trucks are player-colored (each player has 5).

Trains: rail transport; each train can move up to 6 supplies one-way in the moment it is placed. Trains are black and shared among players via common stocks/reserve.

Transport tokens primarily represent traffic / congestion and capacity: you place them to perform a single transport, then they remain until Theater Re-Organization clears them.

4. Cards and What They Represent
4.1 Pursuit Cards (Player-specific)

Each player has a deck of 18 Pursuit cards in their color. These represent events during advances into new areas without Soviet markers.

Rule for drawing: when your Army enters an uncontrolled area without a Soviet marker, you draw from your Pursuit deck and resolve it.

Some Pursuit cards can be kept if they have a hand symbol (details in the Movement section).

4.2 Soviet Cards (Shared)

Soviet cards represent the enemy’s organized defenses.

Rule for drawing: when your Army enters an uncontrolled area with a Soviet marker, you draw from the shared Soviet deck and resolve it.

4.3 OKH Cards (Shared, optional “*” module)

OKH cards represent special capabilities and single-use actions available via the HQ marker (Rule 16*).

The OKH deck and the revealed OKH pool are shared among all players.

4.4 Front Cards

Each player has a Front card that determines the priority order for their Soviet Reaction at the end of their turn. You do not freely choose the reaction; you must follow the Front card priorities, with tie-break resolution by the player to your left.

4.5 Logistic Cards

Each player has one Logistic Card placed in front of them. This card represents the player’s current logistical capabilities at a given moment in the game.

The card contains three values, each defining a different limit:

Take
The maximum total number of trucks and trains that the player may take from the transport track during the Take Transportation action.

Place
The maximum total number of trucks and trains that the player may place onto the board from their resources during the Transport Supplies action.

Possess
The maximum total number of trucks and trains that the player may have in their resources at any one time.

Logistic Card – Front Side

The front side of the card shows the current logistics values for Level 1. It includes:

The logistics level indicator Level 1

Three numeric limits corresponding to Take=6, Place=3, and Possess=9, shown with icons representing trucks and trains.

These values define how many transport units the player can acquire, deploy, and store while this side of the card is active.

This side is the active side during gameplay and directly affects the player’s available actions.

Logistic Card – Back Side

The back side of the card shows the alternative logistics level 2.

It contains the same three limits, but with different values (Take=8, Place=4, Possess=12), reflecting a change in the player’s logistical capabilities.

The card may be flipped when game effects, upgrades, or events change the player’s logistics level. Once flipped, the newly visible side becomes active and replaces the previous limits.

5. The Game Board and Key Terms

The map is point-to-point and includes:

5.1 Area Types

Ordinary areas: oval spaces in player colors (gray/white/brown) or black. A player may enter only their own color areas and black areas.

Double-color areas: oval spaces split between two player colors; either matching-color player may enter, but once one player controls it (places a marker), the other player may no longer enter it.

Fortified areas: if you do not control the area, entering requires you to spend 1 ammo from the entering Army’s card immediately.

Main Supply Bases: cross-shaped areas where you may place supplies using the Take Supply action.

Frontline Supply Base: an additional supply-placement area (explicitly mentioned for the brown player in the excerpt) usable under specific limits (see Take Supply).

Objective areas: areas with a printed medal; capturing them awards a medal token if available.

Victory areas: the star-shaped key cities (Moscow, Leningrad, Rostov). These are fortified areas.

5.2 Connections (Lines)

Colored arrows/lines connect areas. An arrow’s direction is irrelevant for movement and transport; adjacency exists if areas are connected by an arrow in any direction and any color, but you may move only along connections in your color (and into legal areas as above).

Double lines work like a single line but are available to two players whose colors match the line.

Red lines are unusable by players; they matter only for Soviet Reaction and Encirclement.

5.3 Markers and Their Meanings

Player markers indicate control of areas. An area with your marker is controlled by you.

Player markers have railway-track symbols on the reverse; these are used for rail coverage (enabling train transport more efficiently).

Some areas have printed, permanent control and permanent rail coverage (starting areas and some nearby areas).

Soviet markers indicate strengthened Soviet defense and also function as the game-end timer (the game ends when the Soviet marker pool is depleted, subject to end-of-round completion).

Medal tokens are placed on printed-medal objective areas during setup (star side up). When a player receives one, it is flipped to its Iron Cross side.

Some Soviet cards also have medal symbols; those medals are worth the same as medal tokens, and you do not also take a medal token for that same medal gain.

HALT markers indicate Armies grounded due to lack of food after Theater Re-Organization.

HQ markers (optional module) are used to obtain OKH support.

Air support markers (optional module) are used to perform Air Support.

6. Game Setup
6.1 Choose Army Group and Seating

Players choose (or are assigned) Army Groups:

Gray = Nord, White = Mitte, Brown = Sud

Recommended seating: White at the bottom/west, Gray left/north, Brown right/south.

6.2 Player Areas and Starting Units

Each player:

Places their Army cards face up.

Places their Army miniatures in starting areas matching the printed flags.

Places their 5 trucks, and 3 trains near their Army cards as initial resources.

Takes and shuffles their 18-card Pursuit deck, face down, with a discard pile.

The gray player places the Fleet in the sea area near Danzig.

6.3 Initial Army Supplies

Place supplies onto each Army card as printed:

Armored Army: 3 fuel and 3 ammo

Field Army: 2 food, 1 fuel, 3 ammo

6.4 Supply Placement on the Board

Put 3 food, 3 ammo, 3 fuel in each Main Supply Base.

Put 1 food, 1 ammo, 1 fuel into the Supply Stock.

6.5 Train Stocks and Reserve

Put 9 trains into the Transportation Stock.

Put remaining trains into the Transport Reserve:

8 trains in a 3-player game

6 trains in a 2-player game

4 trains in a solitaire game

6.6 Logistics Chart Starting Level

Each player places a marker at level 1 on the Logistics Chart.

6.7 Soviet Deck Setup

Divide Soviet cards into two decks by edge color (green vs blue):

Shuffle the blue-edged deck and place it face down.

Shuffle the green-edged deck and place it on top of the blue deck, face down.

This combined stack is the shared Soviet draw deck.

6.8 Front Cards

Assign Front cards:

Gray takes the north-western front

White takes the western front

Brown takes the south-western front

6.9 Soviet Markers Setup

Place Soviet markers on all areas with the Soviet symbol (including or excluding the victory areas as shown in the excerpt line; the excerpt includes “including the 3 victory areas” earlier in board description and again mentions them during marker placement—follow the printed setup instruction of your edition’s map and symbol placement). Then place additional Soviet markers beside the board depending on player count:

6 markers (3-player)

4 markers (2-player)

3 markers (solitaire)

6.10 Medal Tokens Setup

Place one medal token (star side up) on each printed-medal area, except Kiev gets 2 medals.

6.11 Air Support and HQ Markers (Optional module)

Each player receives:

1 air support marker (their color)

1 HQ marker (their color)

6.12 OKH Cards (Optional module)

Shuffle the OKH deck.
Reveal and display:

Top 4 OKH cards (or 3 in a 2-player game)
Place the face-down OKH deck beside them.

6.13 Turn Order and Starting Medals

Determine player turn order by any method.
Place player markers on the Player Order Track.
All players except the first player receive 1 medal.

6.14 Two-Player and Solitaire Map Blocking

Two-player game:

Areas belonging to the non-player color(s) become permanently controlled by the third non-player Army Group (excluding certain double-color cases described). Place their markers to block these areas; players cannot enter/capture them.

Solitaire game:

Areas belonging to the two non-player Army Groups are permanently controlled and blocked similarly (excluding certain double-color cases as described). You cannot enter/capture them.

7. Round Structure and Turn Sequence

The game is played in rounds. In each round, each player takes one turn in the order shown on the Player Order Track.

On your turn you:

Perform actions (regular + possible additional actions)

After all actions, resolve:

Railhead Advancement Phase

Soviet Reaction Phase

After the last player acts, a new round begins.

7.1 Actions You Can Take

On your turn, you normally do:

2 regular actions (you may repeat the same action twice), chosen from:

Move all Field Armies (Rule 7)

Move one Armored Army (Rule 7)

Move the Fleet (Rule 10)

Transport Supplies (Rule 11)

Take Supply (Rule 12)

Take Transport (Rule 13)

You may also do additional actions when applicable, including:

Using a Recon card

Using an Axis Auxiliaries card (maximum one per turn)

Using Air Support (Rule 15*, optional)

Taking/using an OKH card via HQ (Rule 16*, optional)

7.2 Action Completion Rule (No Partial Interruptions)

Each action must be fully completed before starting another action. The excerpt explicitly notes:

You cannot interrupt an Armored Army movement action mid-way (for example, after step 2 of a 3-step move) to play a Recon card.

The main interruption exception is Theater Re-Organization, which can trigger immediately and pauses the current player’s turn while all players resolve it, then the current player resumes.

8. End of Game and Victory
8.1 When the Game Ends

The game ends when either:

A player achieves Immediate Victory, or

The last Soviet marker from the Soviet marker pool is placed on the board (or discarded to the game box because it cannot be placed). If this happens, play continues until the end of the round.

If the last Soviet marker is placed during player 1 or 2’s turn, remaining players still take their final turns. They cannot place Soviet markers (because the pool is empty), but they can still counter-attack if rules allow.

8.2 Immediate Victory

You win immediately if one of your Armies:

Enters and captures Moscow, Leningrad, or Rostov, and

That capturing Army has a continuous connection of player-controlled areas to its Main Supply Base (including both the victory area and the base area).

Special assignment note from the excerpt:

Moscow can be captured by any player.

Leningrad is the gray player’s assigned victory city.

Rostov is the brown player’s assigned victory city.

8.3 Standard Victory

If no Immediate Victory occurs, the winner is the player with the most medals at game end.

Medals come from:

Medal tokens you collected

Medals printed on defeated armies / Soviet unit cards (as described)

Additional scoring conversion:

For every 3 ammo cubes on these cards that are not marked with a medal, you may exchange them for 1 medal marker.

Victory area control is worth 2 medals even in the rare case that a player captured a victory area but the capturing Army has no continuous connection to the player’s Main Supply Base (this is stated under Standard Victory scoring, and is distinct from the Immediate Victory requirement).

Tie-breakers:

Player with more encircled Soviet cards wins the tie.

If still tied, the result remains a tie.

8.4 Solitaire Victory

If you achieve Immediate Victory in solitaire, your score is the number of turns it took.
If you fail to achieve Immediate Victory, you may use Standard Victory counting.

9. Army Movement (Rule 7)
9.1 Movement Actions

A single movement action is either:

Move all your Field Armies, or

Move one Armored Army

Activation limit:

A given Army can be activated to move only once per turn, even if additional actions are granted by cards/OKH.

Movement is along connections (arrows) in the Army owner’s color; arrow direction is irrelevant.

9.2 Field Armies

Normally move 1 area per activation.

If they did not engage in combat, they may do a forced march to move one additional area by spending 1 food.

9.3 Armored Armies (Panzergruppe)

To activate an Armored Army’s move:

Remove 1 fuel from its Army card to the Supply Stock.
Then it may move up to 3 areas.

9.4 Area Entry Restrictions

An Army may enter only:

Areas of the owner’s color, and

Black areas (as stated in the board rules)

Armies cannot enter:

An area occupied by another Army miniature (your own or another player’s)

An area with another player’s marker (even if you do not intend to stop there)

A double-color area already controlled by the other eligible player (once a marker is placed, it becomes exclusive)

9.5 Entering Fortified Areas

If you enter a fortified area you do not control (no player marker there yet):

You must immediately spend 1 ammo from the entering Army card.

9.6 Capturing and Card Draw Trigger

Entering an area you already control does not trigger a draw.

When an Army enters an unoccupied area you do not control, it stops and you draw:

From your Pursuit deck if the area has no Soviet marker

From the shared Soviet deck if the area has a Soviet marker

Then you resolve the card.

After resolving the card, you place your player marker on the captured area unless you lost combat and had to withdraw.

9.7 Handling Supplies During Movement

If an Army enters an area with supply tokens, it may immediately move those supplies onto its Army card (within the 6-supply Army card limit).

A moving Army can freely drop supplies from its card into any area it enters or occupies (this is not a separate action).

All supplies spent during movement are returned to the Supply Stock.

Supplies acquired due to Pursuit card effects come from the Supply Stock; if the stock lacks that type, you do not gain it.

9.8 Cards That Stop Movement

From the excerpts:

Soviet bombers / Mud stops movement in that area.

An Armored Army may continue by spending 1 additional fuel from its card.

A Field Army cannot continue moving after this.

If you reveal an enemy unit and fight combat:

An Armored Army may continue if it wins and the owner spends 1 fuel from its card (and it has not exceeded its movement limit).

A Field Army cannot continue moving after combat.

All other cards do not stop movement; movement continues as usual (including a Field Army forced march if still eligible).

9.9 Timing of Card Effects vs Continued Movement

If you want to apply a card effect after revealing it, you must do so:

Before continuing that Army’s movement, or

If the Army is done moving, before starting another action.

9.10 Pursuit Card Retention Rule (Hand Symbol)

After resolving a Pursuit card, discard it to your discard pile, except:

You may keep Axis Auxiliaries and Recon cards with a hand symbol as resources to use for additional actions in the current or later turn.

If an Axis Auxiliaries or Recon card does not have a hand symbol, it must be used during the same turn it was drawn, but only after completing the current Army movement action (you still may not interrupt movement mid-action).

Additional restriction:

Only one Axis Auxiliaries card can be played per turn.

10. Pursuit Cards: Effects (as listed)

Unless a card has a hand symbol and you keep it, discard it immediately after resolving.

Captured stock: Place 1 ammo from Supply Stock into the area your Army just entered.

Captured supplies: Place 1 fuel from Supply Stock into the area your Army just entered.

Requisitions: Place 1 food from Supply Stock into the area your Army just entered.

Axis Auxiliaries: Do 1 additional action (so you may do 3 actions instead of 2). Discard after use unless it has a hand symbol, in which case you may keep it for later; discard after later use. Only one Axis Auxiliaries may be played per turn.

Recon: Peek at the top card from a chosen deck (either your Pursuit deck or the Soviet deck). This is an additional action that does not count as one of your regular 2 actions. If it has a hand symbol, you may keep it for later.

Befehl von F. Halder: Move 1 medal from one single-color area to another single-color area with a printed medal and no player marker. You cannot move medals from/to the area your Army has just entered.

Führerbefehl: Move 1 medal from one double-color area to another double-color area with the same two colors and a printed medal and no player marker. You cannot move medals from/to the area your Army has just entered.

Partisans: Flip an opponent’s marker that shows railway track to its other side so that the area no longer has railway track. In solitaire, flip your own marker.

Soviet bombers / Mud: Movement stops unless you spend 1 fuel (Armored only) to continue.

Enemy Reserve Army: Fight a combat; to win against this enemy from your Pursuit deck, spend 1 ammo from the fighting Army’s card.

Other cards: No effect.

11. Combat (Rule 8)

Combat occurs when an enemy unit card is revealed upon entering an area. Combat is resolved by spending supplies from the Army card as required by the enemy card type.

11.1 Soviet Card Combat Costs (as listed)

Enemy Army: spend 2 ammo

Enemy Shock Army: spend 3 ammo

Enemy Armored Corps: spend 2 ammo + 1 fuel

Enemy elite Armored Corps: spend 3 ammo + 1 fuel

(Additionally: from Pursuit deck, Enemy Reserve Army costs 1 ammo to win.)

11.2 Winning and Aftermath

If you have and spend the required supplies:

Spent supplies return to Supply Stock.

You take the defeated enemy card and add it to your resources.

If combat occurred in an area with a Soviet marker, remove that Soviet marker to the pool.

Armored continuation:

If an Armored Army wins a battle and has not yet moved 3 spaces, it may continue its movement if the owner spends 1 fuel from the Army card.

11.3 Losing Combat (Insufficient Supplies)

If you do not have enough supplies:

Spend as much of the required battle cost as possible, then withdraw back to the area you entered from.

The enemy unit card is returned to its deck and that deck is shuffled.

12. Encirclement (Rule 9)

Encirclement is executed immediately whenever placing a player marker causes an encirclement.

12.1 What Becomes Encircled

Uncontrolled areas (and groups of areas) become encircled if they cannot trace a continuous chain of uncontrolled areas to a Victory Area, because all paths are blocked by player markers.

A Soviet chain of communication can also be traced through sea areas if there is a Harbor.

12.2 Effects of Encirclement

When encirclement happens:

Each encircled area becomes controlled by the player whose color matches the area; place that player’s marker there.

An encircled double-color area becomes controlled by the player who just placed the marker that caused the encirclement.

Encircled Soviet markers are removed from the board to the pool.

For each encircled Soviet marker removed, remove 1 Soviet card from the Soviet deck without revealing it and add it (still unrevealed) to the resources of the player whose turn is in progress.

13. Fleet Movement (Rule 10)

The Fleet is controlled by the gray player.

The fleet may be moved between sea areas only once per turn.

This limit still applies even if the gray player gains an additional action.

The fleet moves 1 sea area per movement.

The fleet blocks Soviet sea-based communication through its current sea area, assisting in encirclement.

14. Transport Supplies (Rule 11)

Transport is executed by placing trucks/trains on connections between two areas you control, and transporting supplies immediately at placement time.

14.1 Key Rules

Transport happens only at the moment the truck/train is placed.

You cannot use trucks/trains already on the board from previous turns/actions to transport again.

Each placed truck transports up to 4 supplies one-way.

Each placed train transports up to 6 supplies one-way.

Transport is one-way only.

Arrow direction is irrelevant; you may transport in either direction.

14.2 Placement Limits

During one Transport Supplies action, the number of transports you can perform is limited by:

How many trucks/trains you have available in your pool/resources, and

The maximum number you may place at your current Logistics Chart level (Transport Placement row).

Because the excerpt does not include the chart values, follow the printed Logistics Chart in your game for the exact per-level limits.

14.3 Where Trucks Can Be Placed

Trucks can be placed only between:

Two areas you control

Connected by arrows in your color
Railway track presence does not matter for trucks.

14.4 Where Trains Can Be Placed

Trains can be placed only between:

Two controlled areas that have railway tracks

Connected by arrows in your color

Both areas must have a continuous connection of areas to your supply base (main or frontline)

14.5 Track and Free Supply Handling

If supply tokens are on an area occupied by an Army, that Army can freely move supplies to/from its Army card at any time during your turn (not an action).

Supplies can exist only on areas controlled by players.

If a player marker is removed from an area that has supplies on it, remove those supplies to the Supply Stock.

14.6 Stacking and Exclusivity of Transports on Connections

A truck on a connection does not prevent placing a train on that same connection, and vice versa.

It is illegal to place a truck on a connection already occupied by another truck.

It is illegal to place a train on a connection already occupied by another train.

15. Take Supply (Rule 12)

You may place supply tokens into your Main Supply Base, taking them from the Supply Stock.

Brown player special: the brown player can also place supplies into their Frontline Supply Base, but the Frontline base can be used to take supplies only once per turn.

15.1 Area Supply Limits

A Main Supply Base can hold up to 9 supply tokens.

All other friendly areas can hold up to 6 supply tokens.

Supplies on an Army card do not count against the area limit.

If an area exceeds its supply limit, the controlling player decides which excess supplies are returned to the Supply Stock.

15.2 Supply Scarcity

The total supplies are deliberately limited. If a supply type is depleted in the Supply Stock, players cannot take that type.

16. Take Transport (Rule 13)

You take trucks (your color) and/or trains from the Transport Stock and place them into your player area.

Limits:

You cannot take more than allowed by your Logistics Chart “Take” row for your current level.

You also cannot exceed the maximum number you are allowed to “Possess” (trucks + trains combined), shown on the Logistics Chart.

If a Take Transport action leaves no trains in the Transport Stock, immediately trigger Theater Re-Organization.

17. Theater Re-Organization (Rule 14)

Triggered immediately when there are no trains left in the Transport Stock. It interrupts the current player’s turn and is resolved by all players, then the paused turn resumes.

A player may choose not to trigger it by taking fewer trains so that at least one remains in stock.

During Theater Re-Organization:

All players shift their Logistics Chart marker from level 1 to level 2 (one time only).

All players remove all trucks and trains from the board and return them to the Transport Stock.

Each Army on the board immediately spends 1 food.

Every Army without food on its card or in its area is grounded (place a HALT marker).

No further effect on already grounded Armies.

A grounded Army cannot be moved until its owner delivers food to its area. When food is delivered to its area:

1 food is automatically spent, and

the HALT marker is removed.
You cannot transport food through that area without spending it to feed the Army.

After players reach Logistics Level 2:

Move 2 extra trains, plus 2 extra trains per player (e.g., 8 trains in a 3-player game), from the Transport Reserve to the Transport Stock.

Also refresh:

Turn all HQ markers face up again.

Turn all air support markers face up again.

18. Air Support (Rule 15*, optional)

Air Support is an additional action:

Peek at the top card of a chosen deck (your Pursuit deck or the Soviet deck) and return it face down.

Place your air support marker on top of that deck.

Effect:

If you later draw the top card from that deck due to entering an area (and thus it affects you), then in that area you spend one ammo less than normal for either:

Entering a fortified area, or

Fighting a combat in that area.

Restrictions:

You cannot provide air support to other players; it only helps the marker’s owner.

Your air support marker returns to you:

After a Theater Re-Organization, or

After the top card of that deck is revealed (and then it supports only that one reveal for its owner).

If multiple air support markers are on the same deck, all return to owners when the top card is revealed.

Each player has exactly one air support marker; you cannot perform Air Support again until it returns.

This also applies even if an OKH card grants an air-support-like action, unless that OKH card explicitly overrides this (see Stukageschwader).

19. Army Group HQ and OKH Cards (Rule 16*, optional)

You may use your HQ marker to take one of the currently available face-up OKH cards from the OKH pool.

This “Support from OKH” is not considered an action and can be done at any time during your turn.

After using HQ to take an OKH card, flip your HQ marker face down.

You cannot use HQ again until Theater Re-Organization refreshes HQ markers.

After taking an OKH card, immediately reveal a new OKH card to replace it in the pool.

Using OKH cards:

You may use the OKH card during your turn to do its special action (some are played during another action).

After resolving, discard the OKH card to the game box.

OKH cards and effects listed:

Transportflottille: Place 1 food, 1 ammo, 1 fuel in one harbor you control.

Brandenburg: During combat, draw a different card from the Soviet deck; place the first card on the bottom of the Soviet deck.

Luftbrücke: Move 1 supply token from the Supply Stock to one of your Armies.

Panzerhaubitzen: Play on an activated Army to add 1 ammo to its card (any time, even during movement/combat).

Pionieren: When activating an Army, it does not have to spend additional ammo when entering a fortified area.

Grosstransportraum: During Transport Supply action, place 1 additional truck above your logistics limit, and each truck placed can carry one additional supply.

Schnellkampfgruppe: During an Armored Army activation, it may move 4 areas instead of 3.

Auftragstatkik: Activate a selected Army to move.

Stukageschwader: Use Air Support even if your marker is flipped as unavailable.

Sicherungs-Division: [Reaction] Cancels a Partisans card after its target is declared.

Eisenbahnpioniere: Turn one of your player markers so the railway track faces up.

Wolfsschanze: Move 1 medal onto any other area with a printed medal and with no player markers.

20. Railhead Advancement (Rule 17)

Railhead advancement improves rail logistics by flipping player markers to their railway-track side.

At the end of your turn (after your actions, as part of the turn-ending sequence), you:

Flip 1 of your player markers track-side up, but it must be in an area adjacent to another of your areas that already has a track symbol.

Starting areas have track symbols printed, so they serve as the base for building a chain of rail coverage.

21. Soviet Reaction (Rule 18)

Your turn always ends with a Soviet Reaction. You either:

Place a Soviet marker, or

Do a Soviet counter-attack

You do not freely choose; you follow the priorities on your Front card.

21.1 Placing a Soviet Marker: General Restrictions

Place 1 Soviet marker on any land area that:

Is adjacent to another area with a Soviet marker, and

Has no player marker or printed player symbol

If there is no valid placement, discard the Soviet marker to the game box.

Once the last Soviet marker is placed or discarded, finish the round as described in End Game.

21.2 Soviet Counter-Attack

A counter-attack removes a player marker from the board back to the owner’s pool.

Exception: in solitaire, you remove your own markers.

Counter-attack targeting restrictions (from the excerpt example and notes):

The removed marker cannot be in or adjacent to any starting area or any Army miniature, and cannot be underneath an Army miniature.

The removed marker must be adjacent (connected by an arrow in any color) to an uncontrolled area or an area with a Soviet marker.

Armies protect all adjacent areas against counter-attacks, even if those markers belong to another player. HALTed armies still protect adjacent areas.

21.3 Front Card Priority Resolution

At the end of your turn, you place a Soviet marker or do a counter-attack according to your Front card’s priority rules.

If there is uncertainty, the player to your left resolves your Soviet reaction (Nord left of Mitte, Mitte left of Sud, Sud left of Nord).
